Chapter 8
=========

* `apply` for dynamic Module:Function calls
* `-import(module, [fun/arity, ...])`
* `-UserDefinedAttr(Value)`
* Dynamic code loading acheived by recompiling modules, since calls look to the new fun
* Only two version of a module can exist running: old and new
* `$ erlc -P modulename.erl`
* `$\^C = 3`
* C-like macros
* Process Dictonary is probably a mistake
* `_Name` is usually better than `_`
