ProgrammingErlang
=================

My solutions for the exercises in Armstrong's Erlang book: Programming Erlang, Second Edition: Software for a Concurrent World.

The goal of this repository is to present a solution to every end-of-chapter problem.
As a beginner to Erlang, there should be noticeable progress in programming style as I advance in the book. Also provided are my own notes for each chapter.
