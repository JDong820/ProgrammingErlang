Programming with Files
======================

* `file`, `filename`, `filelib`, `io`
* Data can be parsed as Erlang terms, string,  or binary
* can get file handle and read/write line by line with `io`, or
read/write in one operation with `file`
* `pread` random access
* `#fileinfo` record
* redundant `access` and `mode`
